# Description
Join the 'Employee Attribution Prediction' Hackathon and Predict the Future of Talent Management!

In the dynamic world of business, understanding and predicting employee attribution is crucial. Bluechip Technologies presents an exciting hackathon focused on harnessing the power of data and AI to forecast and analyze employee attribution trends.

As an AI and data enthusiast, data scientist, or technology expert, you'll have the opportunity to dive deep into HR analytics and explore the factors that influence employee turnover. Develop predictive models that provide insights into employee retention, identify patterns, and contribute to strategic talent management.

# Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on [area under the ROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

# Submission File
For each EmployeeNumber in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable Attrition. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
>EmployeeNumber,Attrition  
>1677,0.78  
>1678,0.34  
>1679,0.55  
>etc.

# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a Employee Attrition. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

# Files
 * train.csv - the training dataset; Attrition is the binary target
 * test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive Attrition
 * sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

# Timeline
 * Start Date - November 20, 2023
 * Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
 * Final Submission Deadline - December 6, 2023

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM WAT on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.
